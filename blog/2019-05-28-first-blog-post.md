🚀 Embracing DevOps and Platform Engineering for Modern Businesses 🚀

In the ever-evolving tech landscape, DevOps is more alive than ever. At Resizes, we're harnessing the power of DevOps methodologies and best practices to revolutionize Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and implement Platform Engineering across companies of all sizes.

🔑 Our goal? To fulfill the original DevOps promise: “you build it, you run it”.

💡 Enhancing Developer Experience with Cloud Native Tech: With the latest in Cloud Native technologies, we're here to dramatically improve your Developer Experience (DevEx). Our approach ensures that your development teams are not bogged down by repetitive tasks, fostering high performance and reducing dependency on Ops teams.

🌟 The Secret to High-Performing Teams? Teams that excel have one thing in common: they've built an Internal Developer Platform that's pivotal to their DevOps success. These platforms not only boost developer experience and productivity but also utilize a blend of open-source and proprietary tools, treating the platform as a critical product.

🛠️ Build or Be Built: Remember, if you don't proactively build your platform, it will inevitably build itself. The real question is whether you standardize this process or leave it to chance.

📊 DORA Metrics in Focus: We're keeping a keen eye on key DORA metrics like deployment frequency, change lead time, change failure rate, and MTTR (service production restoration time) to ensure peak performance.

📦 Containerization: The Scale Game-Changer: In our journey, containerization has emerged as the essential element for scaling apps efficiently.

Join us at Resizes in shaping the future of DevOps and Platform Engineering. Let's create systems that not only work but excel in the modern digital era.
