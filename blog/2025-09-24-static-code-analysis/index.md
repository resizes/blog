## Shift-left phylosophy: Why does security matter?
*Example NPM*
*Explain the increasing complexity of modern software: lots of dependencies, containerization, and distributed codebases*
*Emphasize why security is critical early in the development lifecycle (shift-left security).*
You might remember the recent supply chain attack targeting NPM packages — perhaps your team was among those affected. It was a stark reminder that a single vulnerable dependency can cause widespread disruption.

Modern software is more complex than ever, with distributed codebases, countless dependencies, and fast-moving updates. Teams often overlook outdated packages or inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities, creating a critical security risk.

This is where shift-left security comes in: catching problems early in the development lifecycle. By doing so, teams can protect their code, users, and business before issues reach production.

So, if security is this important, how do we actually make our code safe? That’s where **Application Security Testing (AST)** enters the picture.

## Application Security Testing: What It Is and How It Works
*Discuss why these tools matter beyond compliance: catching issues early, reducing risk, protecting users.*
*Introduce the idea of different types of security tools: SAST (static analysis), secret scanning, and software composition analysis.*
AST don’t just help teams check boxes for compliance — **they catch issues early**, reduce risk, and safeguard users.

AST encompasses several approaches, each targeting a different layer of potential risk:
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Scans your source code for vulnerabilities like insecure function calls or unvalidated user inputs before the application is even run.
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects sensitive information accidentally committed to your repositories, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Examines your dependencies and open-source libraries to identify known vulnerabilities, outdated versions, or licensing issues.

With these tools, teams gain **broad visibility** into potential security issues across code, dependencies, and secrets. AST doesn’t just flag problems — it helps teams **prevent vulnerabilities before they reach production**, enabling a proactive security mindset.

## Integrating Security into Your Workflow
*Show how SAST + SCA + secret scanning complement each other*
*Explain why it is a good idea to include them inside the CI/CD pipeline and different approaches*
Having the right types of security checks is essential, but the **real impact** comes from **embedding them directly into your development workflow**. Integrating AST tools into your **CI/CD pipeline** ensures that every commit, pull request, or build is scanned automatically.  

This approach makes security part of the natural development rhythm: issues are caught early, developers receive actionable feedback, and teams can **shift left**, preventing problems before they reach production and **turning strategy into everyday practice**.

By automating these checks, teams also reduce human error, enforce consistent standards, and gradually build a culture of proactive security that scales with the organization.

## Tools Used
*Explain Trivy, TruffleHog, and Semgrep*
*Explain our solution*
*How to implement the solution*
Once a workflow is in place, the right tools make it practical. In our setup, we rely on a combination of specialized tools to cover different layers of security:
- **Trivy** (SCA): Scans container images and dependency's versions for known vulnerabilities, helping teams catch risky components before deployment.
- **TruffleHog** (secret scanning): Detects secrets, credentials, and sensitive data that may have been accidentally committed to repositories.
- **Semgrep** (SAST): Provides customizable static analysis rules to find insecure patterns in code and enforce best practices across projects.

Our solution integrates these tools seamlessly into the CI/CD pipeline, so scans run automatically with every commit or pull request. Developers get immediate feedback on potential issues through a report, allowing them to fix problems before they reach production, without disrupting the flow of development.

Together, automation and visibility don’t just detect problems — they enable a culture of proactive security, making safety a natural part of daily development.

## Minimizing Risk: Do You Really Need That Dependency?
*Concept of risk surface*
*Helping the team understand their decisions*
Every dependency you add to a project opens a potential door for vulnerabilities. Even widely used libraries can introduce security risks, outdated versions may have known exploits, and unmaintained packages can silently accumulate issues over time. This is what we call the risk surface — the sum of all points where your application could be attacked.

Minimizing this risk starts with intentional decision-making. Before adding a new dependency, ask: Do we really need it? Is it actively maintained? Are there safer alternatives? Encouraging teams to think critically about each dependency not only reduces the attack surface but also promotes ownership of security decisions.

It’s also important to regularly audit existing dependencies. Even packages that seemed safe when first added can become risky over time. By combining these audits with automated tools like SCA scanners, teams stay ahead of vulnerabilities instead of reacting to incidents after they occur.

In short, managing dependencies thoughtfully is a crucial part of building secure software. Security isn’t just about catching vulnerabilities — it’s about reducing the potential avenues for risk before they ever appear.


## Starting Small and Staying Realistic
*Acknowledging this is a big effort, especially for smaller teams, and may not be achievable immediately*
*Share tips on educating teams to interpret scan results effectively*
Implementing comprehensive security practices can feel overwhelming, especially for smaller teams or projects with tight deadlines. It’s important to remember that security is a journey, not a one-time fix.

Start by focusing on the areas with the highest impact: critical repositories, major dependencies, or parts of the codebase that handle sensitive data. Gradually expand coverage over time, adding more rules, tools, and automation as the team gains confidence and experience.

Equally important is education and empowerment. Tools will flag vulnerabilities, but developers need to understand what the alerts mean and how to address them effectively. Regularly reviewing findings, sharing lessons learned, and fostering a culture where security is part of everyday development turns a daunting task into manageable, incremental progress.

By starting small, prioritizing high-risk areas, and continuously learning, teams can build security into their workflow realistically and sustainably, ensuring that every step forward strengthens both the code and the culture around it.
