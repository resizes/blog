Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than through manual processes. IaC is a key component of DevOps and is used to automate the provisioning of infrastructure in a safe, repeatable, and consistent manner.

## Why Infrastructure as Code?

### Consistency

IaC allows you to provision infrastructure in a consistent manner. This means that you can provision infrastructure in the same way every time, ensuring that your infrastructure is always consistent and predictable.

### Speed

IaC allows you to provision infrastructure quickly. This means that you can provision infrastructure in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days.

### Safety

IaC allows you to provision infrastructure safely. This means that you can provision infrastructure without the risk of human error or misconfiguration.

### Cost

IaC allows you to provision infrastructure at a lower cost. This means that you can provision infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
